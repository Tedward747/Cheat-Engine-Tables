Important:  

For any of the scripts that say "Pause before toggling this one", PAUSE YOUR GAME.  
If you do not it may crash on you. You've been warned.  
The rest can be toggled on and off without pausing.

If something doesn't seem to be working, check my GitHub for updates.  
If you're on the most recent version, open an issue.
