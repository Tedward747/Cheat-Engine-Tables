[Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/) tables for various games.

Download and install CE from their website, then run it. Download the .CT file you want from here and open it to load the cheats into Cheat Engine.

Run the game and [attach cheat engine](https://wiki.cheatengine.org/index.php?title=Tutorials:AttachToProcess) to it.

Select the cheats you want and press space to activate them. Some take a while to turn on, some are instant.

If cheats are nested, the parent needs to be activated before the child can be activated.

If you have a problem with one of my cheat tables not working, open an issue here. They won't likely be able to help you.

If you have a problem with Cheat Engine itself, ask over there. I won't likely be able to help you.

If you cheat during a multiplayer match, you suck.

Happy hacking.
